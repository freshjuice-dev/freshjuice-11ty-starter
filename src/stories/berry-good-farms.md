## The Challenge

Berry Good Farms had been growing premium organic berries for three generations. While their fruit was legendary at local farmers markets, their online presence was... well, a bit rotten:

- **Outdated website** that looked like it was designed in the flip phone era
- **No subscription system** despite loyal customers wanting regular deliveries
- **Manual order processing** eating up hours of precious farming time
- **Zero online visibility** in an increasingly digital marketplace

## The Solution

We helped Berry Good Farms plant the seeds for digital success with a complete website overhaul focused on their unique farm-to-table story.

### 1. Farm-Fresh Design

We created a visually stunning website that showcases their beautiful berries and tells the authentic story of three generations of farming expertise. The design is as organic as their produce.

### 2. Subscription Berry Box

We implemented a flexible subscription system that lets customers receive fresh berries on their schedule. Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, the choice is theirs, and the berries are always fresh.

### 3. Automated Harvest

From order processing to delivery notifications, we automated the entire fulfillment workflow. Now the team can focus on what they do best, growing incredible berries.

## The Results

The harvest exceeded all expectations:

- **Online sales grew 500%** in the first year
- **12,000 subscribers** signed up for the Berry Box
- **85% repeat customer rate** proves the berries (and website) keep them coming back
- **Word of mouth alone** drove growth with zero paid advertising

## Looking Forward

Berry Good Farms is now expanding their product line to include jams, preserves, and seasonal gift boxes. Their success has inspired other local farms to modernize, creating a thriving community of tech-savvy agricultural businesses.

The family jokes that their website now gets more compliments than their prize-winning strawberries, and honestly, we consider that the sweetest victory of all.
